Data Structures and Algorithms Interview Notes

1. What is time complexity?
Time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes relative to input size.

2. What is space complexity?
Space complexity measures the amount of memory used by an algorithm.

3. What is the difference between array and linked list?
Array uses contiguous memory and allows random access.
Linked list uses nodes connected via pointers and allows dynamic size.

4. What is a stack?
Stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure.

5. What is a queue?
Queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure.

6. What is hashing?
Hashing maps data to fixed-size values using a hash function.

7. What is dynamic programming?
Dynamic programming solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results.
